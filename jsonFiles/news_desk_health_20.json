And I highly gratified, also, that 1 have the honor to see from these that you, gentleman, and your fallow.. citizens have bestowed so attention to the of Huagery se not to be subjected to , but so as to be able readily to understand ate. That is n grunt benefit to me, because, unfortunately, though 1 de clare that 1 find here in the Unite) States a more just and exact of tile iron stain of the cause of Hungary than elsewhere in the , stilt I am to rind that there are and misrepresentations concerning that cause as for instance, I have had the opportunity to rend this day a report of the debates yesterday in the Senate of the United States, where nn member stated that the struggle of ;;ary was not a struggle for the principles of freedom an) liberty ouch as is going on throughout Europe, bill a struggle for an ancient charter. Now this is nn entire lion of the nature of our cause. Thorn is in the struggle of Hungary which cal be characterized by that word, but vva had oleo a struggle tbr rights, because the right of self government in an ancient right of Hungary . It was no stew acquisition to our revolution : it was nn ancient right of a thousand years. Now we have seen that this ancient right of -tLe right of -though by a thousand laws and by the coronation oat4 of thirty kings, every one of whore was committed, in , to a perjury, is not now enjoyed but has 6o come n dead letter in our book of laws. And therefore in our revolution, and before the revolution, in a peace. tul and lawful of legislation, in 113 we struggled and we achieved to get same practical guarantees to thin ancient right of Hungary-such guarantees as were con. necessary to insure that ancient right to Lo n practical benefit and not a mere letter in our of laws. Iu so much we have struggled for our ancient rights, but in rio other respect, because we have seen, that though this ancient right of self government was re in n hundred laws and was guaranteed by coronations,-still it was a dead letter-and why ? lle the whole people warn not inten;sted in maintain ing the rights of Hungary-because tile people had do constitutional rights, but only a class of the pen plo of Hungary. I Leg again to be permitted to make a remark which I have made elsewhere, not for your cake, Itcenuae you understand the nature of the cause of Ilun gary, but because there is published abroad n In regard to facts. Then I say that the rights of Ilungary warn restricted in ancient times not to a race but to a class-to a class of nobles-not to a taco prop erly called who carne out a thousand years ago from Aein, because in the of the Magyars were men of every race which settled and remained in the flange. rian territory. There were nobles among the , Sclnves, Gernrana, Wallachians, and the poor who were deprived of their Constitutional rights, warn not only Sclaves and Croats, but Magyars. Tlteroforo it was not a privilege of races but of , of of nobility, to have an interest in the ancient Constitu rights of Ilungary. Now that single class of men -a mere handful, to which I, by the changes of faro and circumstances happen to belong-could never have been sufficient to maintain the rights of tire country against the continual encroachment of the direc. lion, which it is so much in the nature of the house of Austria to exercise, that during all the centuries of its existence not a single man appeared in history out of the of Austria, who was nut the enemy of dom and of popular rights. So, having seen that that class of men was not to maintain the pop ular rights, and chiefly ' having the conviction it ie oat advantageous to have liberty rights n privilege of a class, but that it become the com mon men in the country, it was our (fret duty of the revolution to abolish all these privileges and to .thorn by the common broad basis liberty-liberty for the people of the whole country, without any as to what Church a man prays in, or what tongue ho speaks.
